### **How to search related literature?**



* Identify a research direction
* Give a basic search on a search engine (eg. Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, \& ACM)
*  	list of academic databases and searching the papers - Wikipedia
* Learn how to narrow down your search



### **Three Pass Approach**



Pass 1 : Title, abstract, section and subsection headings, and conclusion

* 5Cs : Category, Context, Correctness, Contributions, and Clarity
* Retain the paper or discard it or place it on hold
* Entire process usually takes **barely 10-15 mins**.



Pass 2 : Figures, Diagrams, Illustrations, and unread references

* Carefully look for the correctness of the illustrations.
* identify relevant unread references for further reading.
* Entire process takes approx one hour.



Pass 3 : Virtual re-implementation of the paper

* Requires great attention to details
* First step towards your future research ideas
* Entire process takes 4 to 6 hours for beginners
